#Project Progress

Last week I decided that my final project would be a trivia game to test and review the class tutorial and mistakes we may have all made. Some questions will be very simple spot the difference type questions (markdown mistake, command line mistake, Zotero input mistake) with a sceenshot of the common error.

Others will be images of data that include a broad question about what we *could* do. For this I am going to use an example of data in AntConc that was not used in the tutorials and ask which broad questions we could ask of the data with our results.

Others still will be puttig into practice the cautions, instructions and hints that the tutorials offered to us for future recongition in our own data. Here I am intereted in bringing up the question of "knowing your data". In my post "knowing your data", I wrote that "the type of data does not *necessarily* pigeon-hole it into one tool or another, but rather the *structure* of the data we have." So these questions are not what we could possibly do, but rather what does the data make possible or impossible? Here I am planning on using questions about topic modeling and what we can and can't gain from it, as well as the structure of data and metadata that determines its function for us.

Like my first post on the final project, I decided to use quick flash card style scenarios because knowing why and when to use a tool is more important than knowing the details whys of how to use a tool. Often a digital tool isn't useful until it becomes imperative to our research. I decided that a trivia game would be a good way to engage our class as a review tool and have some fun. Overall, the goal of the game is to test our digital toolboxes using quick recognition skills of what we've learned-skills that are important time-saving skills if we needed to make real decisions about our real research.

So far, I am struggling with using the right code snippets in twine to have a variable "score" that will add and subtract points throughout the game depending on the player's answer. More to come on that...
